         <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.eclipsecon.org/france2013"><img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://www.eclipsecon.org/france2013/sites/default/files/600x125.png?1358521920" width="600" height="125"/></a></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been invited by <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://blog.benjamin-cabe.com/">Benjamin Cabe</a> to be part of the Program Committee (PC) for <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.eclipsecon.org/france2013">EclipseCon France</a>. Benjamin told me it wouldn&#8217;t take too much time and I thought it would be something interesting. Benjamin was <em>partly</em> right (it does not take too much time, but it definitely takes some time), and I was totally right to think it would be a good experience.</p>
<p>Here are some additional thoughts and explanation about how a Program Committee works</p>
<p><span id="more-440"></span></p>
<h2>So many (good) proposals! So few slots!</h2>
<p>I guess that&#8217;s always the problem when it comes to setting up a conference program. There are always more good talks than the program contains slots. For EclipseCon France, here are the numbers: <strong>130 submissions</strong> for <strong>33 slots</strong>. So it means that 97 submissions were rejected, including a lot of great ones. That is very frustrating at the beginning when you see so many good proposals being declined, but there&#8217;s no way to change that, so PC has to deal with it&#8230;</p>
<h2>So much diversity! So much consistency!</h2>
<p>Although I&#8217;ve been involved in the Eclipse community for some time now, I&#8217;ve been impressed by the diversity of concerns in the Eclipse community and eco-system while reviewing submissions: Machine-2-Machine, Diagrams &amp; DSLs, Requirements, ALM (ie. Testing, Code Quality, Development Productivity&#8230;), JVM languages, other languages, Mobile/Web/Cloud, Product management&#8230; among others. That&#8217;s awesome because all the specific concerns of a topic also apply (with different priority) to other topics. I think that&#8217;s what makes Eclipse and the Eclipse conferences great places for innovation: you can learn and understand from people who do very different things than you, because we share this Eclipse thing.</p>
<p>There are so many topics in the Eclipse community that 3 conferences a year are not too much to cover them all <img src='http://s1.wp.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';)' class='wp-smiley'/> </p>
<h2>How does a PC work?</h2>
<p>I find it interesting to tell you how talks are selected because I have submitted so many talks and got so many declined in the past that it&#8217;s good to know how to turn them &#8220;sexier&#8221; for a next conference and improve their chances of getting accepted.</p>
<p>Each PC member may grade the proposals (from 0 to 5). So every PC member reads all submissions and grades them. After it&#8217;s done, our dedicated PC chair (Benjamin) sends us a summary of the talks sorted out according to average grade, and then starts the time to negotiate: some PC members have very high interest in some talks and may try to convince other PC members to increase their grades on a submission so it gets to the top of the list. Some of these negotiations do work and change the list of accepted talks. At the same time, we try to get some talks to merge to avoid redundant talks and to increase the amount of topics covered. For instance, that&#8217;s how we could merge some IWG or Requirements-Oriented talks, so we are sure these topics are well covered by the program but leave some free slots for other talks. We did another round of negotiations, and we finally got the list of selected talks.</p>
<h2>Advices for future submissions</h2>
<p>Now that you know how selection systems work, you can understand that the grades for your submissions will highly depend on the people in the Program Committee. For EclipseCon France, we have an &#8220;industry-oriented&#8221; program committee, so it&#8217;s easier to get a good average grade if you speak about industry, because it speaks to the majority of the PC. To the contrary, I was the only one showing a big interest in Mobile/Web/Cloud stuff (since that&#8217;s our business at JBoss), so it appeared that most Web-oriented submissions did not get enough interest from other PC members to get into the program.</p>
<p>Based on that experience, here are a few tangible pieces of advice for your future submissions:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Make your title and abstract very clear and explicit</strong>: PC members review a lot of submissions, and read those submissions quickly. So write your title and abstract in a very efficient way to ensure PC won&#8217;t miss the point. I admit there are some talks I did read too quickly to understand how good they were, and I changed my mind when negotiating with other PC members to increase the grade I gave. It can happen to any PC member. Try to make you submission clear enough to compensate a potential PC failure.</li>
<li><strong>Put some context in your abstract</strong>: Some PC members don&#8217;t know what you&#8217;re doing (ie, I don&#8217;t know anything about Requirement stuff, and I guess other people in PC don&#8217;t know anything about Jax-RS and Javascript&#8230;), so if you want a PC member to give a good grade to something he doesn&#8217;t understand, you have to give him some context so he can understand how important is the issue your presentation addresses. <em>What kind of development does it apply to?Â  Which issue does this presentation address?</em></li>
<li><strong>Highlight the added-value of your presentation:</strong> What makes a good talk is a talk that brings value (re-usable knowledge) to attendees. So it&#8217;s interesting to make what your talk will bring to the attendees clear: when selecting a talk, PC members (at least me) are not that interested inÂ <em>what will be presented in the talk</em> but they care aboutÂ <em>How will the attendee be able to take advantage of the content of this presentation? </em>It&#8217;s also interesting to say whether what you&#8217;d like to present contributed to a success-story and could be repeated by attendees to create some more success-stories.</li>
<li><strong>Open-up:</strong> Eclipse is a big community, you&#8217;re probably about to present a small subset of what&#8217;s happening in this community. So try to make your presentation useful to other areas in the community. <em>Could your presentation open to other related technologies/fields?&#8230;</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Whatever is the topic, a clear submission that shows how you used a technology to solve a usual or trendy use-case and how this solution can apply to other use-cases has very big chances of being accepted.</p>
<h2>What&#8217;s next?</h2>
<ol>
<li>First <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.eclipsecon.org/france2013/registration">register to EclipseCon France</a></li>
<li>Think about organizing or presenting some stuff for an <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://wiki.eclipse.org/Eclipse_DemoCamps_Kepler_2013">Eclipse Kepler Demo Camp</a>. Demo Camps are also nice places to meet Eclipse people and learn cool stuff.</li>
<li>Next EclipseCon after EclipseCon France will be in <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.eclipsecon.org/europe2013/">Ludwigsburg, Germany</a> by the end of October.</li>

         <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Here are some news from <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://eclipse.org/swtbot">SWTBot</a>, the famous SWT UI Bot API that&#8217;s widely used in order to write some functional tests!</p>
<p><span id="more-415"></span></p>
<h3>A Test Recorder and Generator</h3>
<p>Together with <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/rawagner">Rastislav Wagner</a> (who&#8217;s a Red Hat colleague working on testing <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.jboss.org/tools">JBoss Tools</a> and <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://marketplace.eclipse.org/node/503834">JBoss Developer Studio</a>), we had the opportunity to meet in person with the whole JBoss Tools team in Brno. We started to work on a draft of a test recorder and generator that could work for both SWTBot, and an Eclipse bot API used by Brno folks called <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/jboss-reddeer">RedDeer</a>.<br />
We made so much progress that we did not simply sketch a way to get it to work; but in the end, we wrote a first simple version of the generator. It&#8217;s quite simple, but it&#8217;s already powerful enough to be useful, so we decided to contribute it to SWTBot.<br />
For more details about the contribution process, you can follow those links: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/9301/">Gerrit contribution</a> (thanks to Matthias Sohn for reviewing it), <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://dev.eclipse.org/mhonarc/lists/swtbot-dev/msg00348.html">disucssion on the developer mailing-list</a>, <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.eclipse.org/forums/index.php/t/441755/">discussion on user forum</a>, and finally the<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://git.eclipse.org/c/swtbot/org.eclipse.swtbot.git/commit/?id=c878ee8136d60ac8a8306007de744e1f979819b0"> Git commit in the source repository</a>.</p>
<p>All this stuff leads us to the ability to install this recorder from the SNAPSHOT p2 repository: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://download.eclipse.org/technology/swtbot/snapshots/">http://download.eclipse.org/technology/swtbot/snapshots/</a></p>
<div id="attachment_423" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width:566px;"><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://mickaelistria.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/swtbotrecorder.jpeg"><img class="size-large wp-image-423" alt="SWTBot Snapshot p2 Reposioty" src="http://mickaelistria.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/swtbotrecorder.jpeg?w=556&#038;h=620" width="556" height="620"/></a><p class="wp-caption-text">SWTBot Snapshot p2 Reposioty</p></div>
<p>Once installed on any RCP application, it&#8217;s pretty easy to use: just set the<em> -Dorg.eclipse.swtbot.generator.enable=true</em> system property. The following video shows a basic use-case</p>
<div class='embed-vimeo' style='text-align:center;'></div> 
<p>It&#8217;s currently limited to a few concepts, but it&#8217;s easy to add support for new widgets, and it can already be used to save a lot of time when writing tests. If you feel interested in contibuting, see <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://wiki.eclipse.org/SWTBot/Contributing">http://wiki.eclipse.org/SWTBot/Contributing</a> and come to the <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://dev.eclipse.org/mailman/listinfo/swtbot-dev">swtbot-dev mailing-list</a> to have a chat.</p>
<p>Rastislav already has plans to implement support for more complex UI operations that match several events, that will be a very interesting to implement and powerful to use improvement!</p>
<h3>Support for Eclipse 4</h3>
<p>SWT has not changed much between Eclipse 3.x and Eclipse 4, so SWTBot still supports most SWT concepts There are <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=385527">very few bugs</a> that are known, but there is no blocker. The most critical one is probably related to the <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=388306">visibility of some menus</a>. Any help to fix one of these bugs is highly welcome.</p>
<p>However, there is an <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=296599">important bug</a> that prevents UI tests (may them use SWTBot or not) from being run with PDE for an Eclipse 4 application. So it&#8217;s difficult to test SWTBot for Eclipse 4 from IDE. Fortunately, Tycho, which is more &#8220;regular&#8221;, is able to run tests that use SWTBot on an e4 application. You can give it a try by <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.eclipse.org/tycho/sitedocs/tycho-surefire/tycho-surefire-plugin/test-mojo.html#product">configuring the product in tycho-surefire-plugin</a> to use an e4 product (such as the contact demo) and use SWTBot in your tests. Make sure e4 bundles are present during tests (they must either be a transitive dependency of the test -<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://mickaelistria.wordpress.com/2011/09/27/swtbot-tip-of-the-day-explicit-your-test-depends-on-ui-contributors/">recommanded</a>-, or you can add them as <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.eclipse.org/tycho/sitedocs/tycho-surefire/tycho-surefire-plugin/test-mojo.html#dependencies">dependencies of test execution</a>).</p>
<p>I think once all the SWTBot for e4 are fixed, we&#8217;ll try to make an official release of SWTBot.</p>
<h3>SWTBot is an open project!</h3>
<p>SWTBot is a community-engaging project: there is activity on the <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.eclipse.org/forums/index.php?t=thread&amp;frm_id=74">user forum</a>, on the <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://dev.eclipse.org/mailman/listinfo/swtbot-dev">developer mailing-list</a>, the wiki makes it easy to learn <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://wiki.eclipse.org/SWTBot/UsersGuide">how to use SWTBot</a>, but also <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://wiki.eclipse.org/SWTBot/Contributing">how to contribute</a>. SWTBot excels in the use of <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://git.eclipse.org/c/swtbot/org.eclipse.swtbot.git">Git</a>, <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/q/project:swtbot/org.eclipse.swtbot,n,z">Gerrit</a>, <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://hudson.eclipse.org/hudson/job/swtbot-tycho/">Hudson</a>, <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://dev.eclipse.org/sonar/dashboard/index/1">Sonar</a>&#8230; All those tools are there to make it easier for users to turn into contributors, and contributors into committers, and to keep productivity and quality at a high level; and they&#8217;ve proven there efficiency on these topics in the last few months. They provide so much feedback on contributions that the process of accepting a patch is made faster.<br />
So if you&#8217;re interested in contributing, please give it a try and feel free to ask for help on the <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://dev.eclipse.org/mailman/listinfo/swtbot-dev">developer mailing-list</a>. The tools and processes are open as well, so please come and suggest better ways of doing things, it will be very appreciated!</p>
<p>All those proofs of openness made that I <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://marketplace.eclipse.org/node/582931">nominated SWTBot for the Most Open Project</a> of <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.eclipse.org/org/foundation/eclipseawards/">Eclipse Community Awards</a>.</p>

<h2>What&#8217;s the current status for most Eclipse projects?</h2>
<p>Most Eclipse projects now have an automated build system, and have this integrated in <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://hudson.eclipse.org/hudson/">Hudson</a>. All projects do have some acceptance tests run on each build, which help project teams to decide whether project is good to get released in its current state or not. So we can say that Eclipse projects are already leveraging <strong>Continuous Integration</strong>.</p>
<h2>Static Code Quality Analysis</h2>
<p>I already mentioned in in an earlier blog post (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://mickaelistria.wordpress.com/2012/04/19/what-happened-to-me-at-eclipsecon-2012/">see #3 in &#8220;my favourite talks&#8221;</a>): Static Code Analysis helps you to find mistakes you&#8217;ve done, and saves you a lot of time/money/stress/[anything you don't want to have]. We are all humans, and humans make mistakes. In software development, we are lucky to have some great tools to tell us quickly and for free when we are doing something wrong. In my previous post, I shared some tricks to get Code Quality Analysis part of your workbench and give you reports as-you-type, but it can also be useful to have also some coarser-grained view of quality accross the project, and not only accross one class.</p>
<p>Tools such as Sonar allows you to see how the quality of your code evolves. It&#8217;s a necessary tool to go from Continuous Integration to Continuous Improvement.</p>
<h2>Why fighting the technical debt?</h2>
<p>Technical debt is all about pieces of your code that are not very beautiful, but which are working correctly. So you are likely to never improve them. You&#8217;ll ask me &#8220;why improving them if this works?&#8221;. There are lots of answers, but I&#8217;ll only give the one that looks the most important for Eclipse.org usage: We are open-source projects, and as committers on those projects, we must think about gettting more and more contributors. Code which has a huge technical debt is way more difficult to tweak for a newcomer to this project than &#8220;clean code&#8221;. Fighting technical debt makes your project more welcoming and more agile (as in agile &#8220;able to move/change quickly without pain&#8221;).</p>
<h2>Important note about code quality before we start speaking of Sonar</h2>
<p>Once again, I&#8217;ll refer to what I learnt there: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.eclipsecon.org/2012/sessions/how-profit-static-analysis">http://www.eclipsecon.org/2012/sessions/how-profit-static-analysis</a>.<br />
If you want to start improving quality, don&#8217;t think on using Sonar first. You first step should probably be to add quality tools in your workbench: enable all JDT warnings, install FindBugs, PMD, and other quality tools. At the beginning, you may find them too verbose, but just do what they want you to do in most cases, and you&#8217;ll see you&#8217;ll probably write less bugs.<br />
First take care of the code you write daily by leveraging such tools, they prevent from increasing the technical debt. You can&#8217;t hope to reduce existing technical debt on one side if you keep on adding some on the other side.</p>
<h2>Why Sonar?</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter" title="sonar-logo" src="http://www.sonarsource.org/wp-content/themes/sonarsource.org/images/sonar.png" alt="" width="100" height="54"/></p>
<p><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.sonarsource.org/">Sonar</a> is basically a &#8220;quality dashboard&#8221;: it shows a lot of metrics and warnings. It relies on several common Java tools (Checkstyle, Findbugs, PMD, Jacoco&#8230;) to provide the reports and show their results in an aggregated view. That helps you to spot which pieces of your code deserve to be improved. It&#8217;s easy to use and is a very informative tool which is intended to projects teams to reduce their technical debt.<br />
Let&#8217;s be honest: I&#8217;ve only known Sonar as an OSS quality dashboard. I don&#8217;t even know if some other exist, but I only hear about this one, and I think it good. Also the team is helpful and reactive, and they are close to the Eclipse community, as you can see by the kind of <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://docs.codehaus.org/display/SONAR/Using+Sonar+in+Eclipse">extension they develop</a>, or their <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.eclipsecon.org/2012/sessions/continuous-inspection-sonar">presence at EclipseCon</a>.</p>
<div id="attachment_391" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width:1034px;"><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://dev.eclipse.org/sonar/dashboard/index/1"><img class="size-large wp-image-391" title="sonar" src="http://mickaelistria.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/sonar.jpeg?w=1024&#038;h=391" alt="" width="1024" height="391"/></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Sonar at work</p></div>
<h2>Strategies to fight technical debt using Sonar reports?</h2>
<p>Quality reports is not something you produce for each build: it takes some time to process and reduce &#8220;acceptance&#8221; feedback loop. Also, this kind of quality metrics evolve slowly, and you&#8217;ll quickly notice that re-computing them in each commit is kind of useless. Instead I&#8217;d recommend using them weekly. or on a schedule that will help you to capture trends of quality. Of course, when you think it&#8217;s useful, you can stuff run a &#8220;Sonar&#8221; job manually to see how metrics evolved after an intense clean.</p>
<p>Some teams have some &#8220;quality hours&#8221;: for example, on the Friday afternoon, when people don&#8217;t want to get into huge difficult tasks before week-end, developers simply have a look at Sonar and decide of reducing amount of Findbugs warnings, or to reduce duplication&#8230; Since you have a tool to tell you what should be improved, those tasks become easy, andÂ we all need some easy tasks from time to time.</p>
<p>So I recommend producing reports weekly, and use Sonar to have some <strong>technical debt shooting sessions</strong>, weekly, or one week after a release build, or on any schedule you like. The important is to turn it into a <strong>regular habit</strong>.</p>
<h2>Setting up a [Project]-Sonar build on hudson.eclipse.org</h2>
<p>Currently, there is one pre-requisite for Hudson-Sonar integration, which is not that big since it&#8217;s already the choice made by many projects, and by CBI: your project needs to build with <strong>Maven </strong>(and Tycho if you&#8217;re building Eclipse plugins).<br />
If you already have a Tycho-based build, it pretty easy:</p>
<ol>
<li><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/enter_bug.cgi?product=Community">Ask</a> for a CI job <em>[Project]-Sonar</em> on Hudson Sandbox</li>
<li>Configure your project to run a normal build with automated tests. Do not include any publishing related stuff (profile, build steps&#8230;) into it, since it&#8217;s not the goal of this job. You may want to set the following Maven properties: <em>-Dmaven.test.error.ignore=true -Dmaven.test.failure.ignore=trueÂ </em>to get reports even when some tests fail.</li>
<li>Go to Post-Build Actions and tick <em>Sonar</em></li>
<li>Ensure the <em>Maven Version</em> is the same as the one that perform the build</li>
<li>Configured Sonar plugin: If you build using on the <em>Private Repository</em> Maven option (recommended), you&#8217;ll need to set <em>Additional Properties</em> for Sonar to <strong>-Dmaven.repo.local=$WORKSPACE/.maven/repo</strong>. It&#8217;s also recommended to set <strong>-XX:MaxPermSize=128m</strong></li>
</ol>
<div id="attachment_390" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width:1034px;"><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://mickaelistria.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/sonar-config.jpeg"><img class="size-large wp-image-390" title="sonar-config" src="http://mickaelistria.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/sonar-config.jpeg?w=1024&#038;h=248" alt="" width="1024" height="248"/></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Sonar configuration for your job</p></div>
<p>You can see an example of configuration here: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://hudson.eclipse.org/sandbox/job/SWTBot-Sonar/configure">https://hudson.eclipse.org/sandbox/job/SWTBot-Sonar/configure</a></p>
<div id="attachment_393" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width:1034px;"><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://mickaelistria.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/hudson-sonar.jpeg"><img class=" wp-image-393" title="hudson-sonar" src="http://mickaelistria.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/hudson-sonar.jpeg?w=1024&#038;h=429" alt="" width="1024" height="429"/></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Sonar reports are 1 click further</p></div>
<p>When you&#8217;re done, just run a build. If it&#8217;s blue or yellow, you&#8217;ll notice a &#8220;Sonar&#8221; link on the left of job&#8217;s page. Click it. You&#8217;re there! You can browse Sonar reports for your job, and find out some interesting stuff about your project that deserve immediate improvement. Just enjoy it, have a look at Sonar reports, find out some Findbugs warning you don&#8217;t like, install Findbugs plugin in your workbench, and spend one hour cleaning some of them. Re-build, and see how Sonar reflected your change.<em> You reduced technical debt!</em></p>
<h2>Bonus: Maven, Jacoco, and Sonar</h2>
<p>Once again, no big difficulty here. There are only 2 constraints/rules to follow:</p>
<ol>
<li>Sonar only allows a single execution file (jacoco.exec) for you whole project</li>
<li>The sonar.jacoco.reportPath so it references this jacoco.exec file from any &#8220;Java&#8221; (plugins or tests) module.</li>
</ol>
<p>For example in case of &#8220;flat&#8221; project: 1 directory containing at its root the parent pom, and all modules (org.eclipse.project.*), you&#8217;d like to configure that in parent pom</p>
<pre>
&lt;properties&gt;
	&lt;!-- Properties to enable jacoco code coverage analysis --&gt;
	&lt;sonar.core.codeCoveragePlugin&gt;jacoco&lt;/sonar.core.codeCoveragePlugin&gt;
	&lt;sonar.dynamicAnalysis&gt;reuseReports&lt;/sonar.dynamicAnalysis&gt;
	&lt;sonar.jacoco.reportPath&gt;../target/jacoco.exec&lt;/sonar.jacoco.reportPath&gt;
&lt;/properties&gt;

&lt;build&gt;
	&lt;plugins&gt;
		&lt;plugin&gt;
			&lt;groupId&gt;org.jacoco&lt;/groupId&gt;
			&lt;artifactId&gt;jacoco-maven-plugin&lt;/artifactId&gt;
			&lt;version&gt;0.5.8.201207111220&lt;/version&gt;
			&lt;executions&gt;
				&lt;execution&gt;
					&lt;goals&gt;
						&lt;goal&gt;prepare-agent&lt;/goal&gt;
					&lt;/goals&gt;
					&lt;configuration&gt;
						&lt;!-- Where to put jacoco coverage report --&gt;
						&lt;destFile&gt;${sonar.jacoco.reportPath}&lt;/destFile&gt;
						&lt;includes&gt;
							&lt;include&gt;org.eclipse.swtbot.*&lt;/include&gt;
						&lt;/includes&gt;
						&lt;append&gt;true&lt;/append&gt;
					&lt;/configuration&gt;
				&lt;/execution&gt;
			&lt;/executions&gt;
		&lt;/plugin&gt;
	&lt;/plugins&gt;
&lt;/build&gt;
</pre>
<p>For 2-folders-deep projects, where there is a parent pom.xml at root + a plugins/ folder containing plugins, and a tests/ folder containing tests, you&#8217;d rather set the <em>sonar.jacoco.reportPath</em> property to <strong>../../target/jacoco.exec</strong> (so all tests and plugins look at the same jacoco.exec which is on there <em>&lt;firstCommonParentDirectory&gt;</em>/target).</p>
<p>Note that there is <strong>no need to put it in a profile</strong>. Indeed jacoco almost doesn&#8217;t affect performance, so it won&#8217;t slow down your build, then you&#8217;d better make it always enabled.</p>

         <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s been a few week since EclipseCon ended. It&#8217;s now time for a retrospective.</p>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width:510px;"><img title="RedHat" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7242/6875296288_dd63828cd5.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="332"/><p class="wp-caption-text">Do you also know the <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href='http://www.redhatsociety.com/events/photos/RHSDay2011.html'>Red Hat Society</a>?</p></div>
<p>First, the event was great. Although I did not have time to view that many presentations, I was able to discuss with a lot of people about a lot of topics. I learned new stuff, and shared some knowledge. I made huge steps ahead in my own work, and helped people to go ahead in their own work too. I was also able to boost some projects I like and work in making them more widely used.<br />
So I am pretty happy of this conference. Being at EclipseCon has and will improve my daily work, that&#8217;s the best thing to expect from this kind of event.</p>
<h1>My Top #3 favourite talks</h1>
<p>Since I spent most of my time chatting with several people, I could only see a few presentations. I&#8217;d like to share 3 of them:</p>
<ul>
<li><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.eclipsecon.org/2012/sessions/persona-non-grata-dont-forget-users-when-doing-your-designs">Persona non grata</a> by Brian Fitzpatrick.<br />
I like this idea to bringÂ  some practices coming from marketingÂ into software development that are aimed to get a better knowledge of what your users want. Introducing Personas seems to be a high benefit for a team, since every participant will be able to talk about these personas instead of limitating users to only a role. It helps to have a clearer idea of what their users are like and can refer easily to them in their daily work. It makes product teams think more about their users being humans and act consequently, for instance when developing UI.
<p><div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width:362px;"><img class=" " title="personas" src="http://hello.boagworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/personas1.png" alt="" width="352" height="257"/><p class="wp-caption-text">Personas allow you to consider your users as people, not only roles.</p></div></li>
<li><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.eclipsecon.org/2012/sessions/eclipse-code-recommenders-code-completion-steroids">CodeRecommanders</a>, by <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.stg.tu-darmstadt.de/staff/marcel_bruch/index.en.jsp">Marcel Bruch</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://eclipse.org/recommenders/">CodeRecommanders</a> won the <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://code-recommenders.blogspot.fr/2012/03/thanks-eclipse-community.html">Best Developer Tool </a>award, this talk demonstrated why this project deserves such a recognition. It is pretty easy to set-up, use and provide immediately a boost in your code-writing productivity. Code Recommanders has analyzed mostÂ  of the open-source Java code on the planet and so comes into your IDE to provide you snippets, templates, examples, pieces of advice and more, gathered from all the code it has analyzed! You can save a lot of time since you do not have to search through the web anymore: CodeRecommanders has snippets and pieces of advice for you. Always.

<li><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.eclipsecon.org/2012/sessions/how-profit-static-analysis">How to profit from static analysis</a>, by Elena Laskavaia<br />
This talk explains why static analysis makes you save (a lot of!) development time and money, and how to get the highest value from it. How not to spend more than necessary in setting it up, and how to get started in making static analysis part of your strategy.Â  Very concrete lessons and tips! Here are my 3 favorite notes:
<ul>
<li>Detecting a bug at dev-time with static analysis costs a few seconds, detecting it at build-time costs minutes to fix it, detecting it in a satellite costs millions. (slide 5)</li>
<li>JDT provides you very good static analysis, but most rules are disabled by default. So just turning these rules on will make you more productive. (slide 18)</li>
<li>full JDT analysis + PMD enabled in your IDE = profit.</li>
</ul>

<h1>What I presented</h1>
<p>This year, I had the opportunity to be a speaker for 3 talks</p>
<h2>How to remain agile in code generation approaches?</h2>
<p>This short presentation during Modeling Symposium explains some good practices to use in order to avoid being locked in code-generation approaches. Indeed, the indirection introduced by code generation can have some pitfalls when it comes to customizing generated code. But actually, you don&#8217;t want to customize generated code, you want to customize generated behavior. Modifying generated code is not the best solution for that, here are some more sustainable approaches:<br />
</p> 
<p>The lesson is: <em>consider generator config/generated code the same way you consider source code/compiled code</em>.</p>
<h2>Some news of GMF Tooling, at Modeling Symposium</h2>

<h3>Get ready to fight your technical debt, with Tycho, Sonar, and Jacoco</h3>
<p>I had the opportunity to present, together with <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://mdwhatever.free.fr/">Xavier Seignard</a>, how easy it is to integrate <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.eclipse.org/tycho/">Tycho</a>, <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://jenkins-ci.org/">Jenkins</a>/Hudson, <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.sonarsource.org/">Sonar</a> and <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.eclemma.org/jacoco/">Jacoco</a> together. This provides a 1st-class build environment that makes you go from continuous integration to continuous improvement. We think code quality is now pretty easy to get, even in the Eclipse world, so we should not do without it any longer. There are now very very very (&#8230;) very powerful and easy tools for quality in the Java world. They work with a few efforts and minutes. That was the aim of this talk: showing people that they are very close to continuous improvement and giving them some keys to set it up by and for themselves.</p>

<p>I was able to also make some lobbying on Sonar@Eclipse.org, so that there is progress on <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=360935">bug 360935</a> ! Woot!</p>
<h1>Things I did</h1>
<p>EclipseCon, like any conference, is mostly a social event. It is a great opportunity to meet people you need to help you, to meet people who need your help; and to get things actually done and gone ahead.</p>
<h2>About Tycho</h2>
<p>Tycho is the masterpiece of builds for projects I work on. With JBoss Tools, we have found some bugs, we often have some new requirements and ideas for improvements. Participating in the Tycho BOF was a great opportunity to chat with the other guys doing/using Tycho and to highlight some issues that are important to us. It&#8217;s worked and we are now pleased to see and provide &#8220;quality patches&#8221;, as Igor likes to say.</p>
<h2>About CBI</h2>
<p>The Eclipse foundation is making an effort to improve the &#8220;Common Build Infrastructure&#8221;. The goal is to provide an efficient and easy-to-use build environment for Eclipse projects. This is something very interesting for Eclipse.org projects, but also for consumers such as JBoss Tools, since we have ideas on making Eclipse projects easier to consume. So that&#8217;s something we follow closely and we are happy to see all these efforts carried out to push Tycho and Jenkins usage for all Eclipse.org projects!</p>
<p><em>Let&#8217;s hope CBI will also address issues regarding p2 repository governance (lifecycle, availability, URL conventions&#8230;).</em> As I am writing,<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=377111"> a bug</a> has just opened on this topic. Coincidence or esoterism?<em><br />
</em></p>
<h2>About GMF-Tooling</h2>
<p>I could see <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://modelingsideoflife.wordpress.com/2012/04/11/gmf-simple-map-at-the-eclipsecon-2012/">the presentation</a> by Andres Alvarez Mattos and Ruben De Dios during Modeling Symposium. These guys made a<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://code.google.com/a/eclipselabs.org/p/gmf-simple-map-editor/wiki/QuickStartGuide"> very nice editor for GMF Tooling models</a> that allows you to create a diagram editor graphically. It is not intrusive and is a much more efficient way to get started with GMF Tooling than the current approach based on models and tree editors. This editor simply looks like a renewal of GMF Tooling.</p>
<p>I helped them to get some of their patches applied into GMF Tooling code. I hope I&#8217;ll be able to nominate them as committers soon, since their editor would make a lot of sense in GMF Tooling.</p>
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>That was a busy EclipseCon! But I enjoyed it! Some things got done, some can now be done, and some others will be done soon. There are some concrete results and some new opportunities, it&#8217;s everything I expected!</p>

         <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I don&#8217;t know if you know it, but I love Jacoco. <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.eclemma.org/jacoco/">Jacoco</a> is a very neat and easy to use coverage tool. You can easily use it with existing Java applications, it is just about <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.eclemma.org/jacoco/trunk/doc/agent.html">giving a -javaagent to your JVM parameters</a>. It is so easy to have coverage reports as it is to increase a PermSize.<br />
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://relengofthenerds.blogspot.com/2011/03/sdk-code-coverage-with-jacoco.html">Everybody loves Jacoco.</a> Those who don&#8217;t love it yet simply need to give it a try to get convinced Jacoco in the only good tool for code coverage.</p>
<p>We did enable Jacoco for our our Tycho-based builds of <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.jboss.org/tools">JBoss Tools</a> and <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.jboss.com/products/devstudio/">JBoss Developer Studio</a> components thanks to its <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.eclemma.org/jacoco/trunk/doc/maven.html">Maven plugin</a>, so <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://hudson.jboss.org/hudson/view/JBossTools/view/JBossTools_Trunk/job/jbosstools-3.3_trunk.component--examples/">we get some very nice jacoco.exec files</a> that developer can <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.eclemma.org/userdoc/importexport.html">import </a>into their Eclipse workspace thanks to EclEmma. Then developers can see how their tests cover their code. That&#8217;s very nice.</p>
<p>But I think that measuring unit test coverage is not the best thing we can do with Jacoco. Since it is just about a simple argument to the Java command-line, we can think of&#8230; <strong>Enabling Jacoco by default on real execution of Java applications to track real usage and deduce which pieces of code are really used</strong>! This is pretty easy to do, and the <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.sonarsource.org/pick-your-code-coverage-tool-in-sonar-2-2/">effect on performances is low</a> enough to be acceptable in a lot of cases, especially on desktop applications.</p>
<p>Knowing which pieces of your software are critical in production, and which ones are useless and should get removed is a priceless information that for sure helps you in making your software better. That&#8217;s a topic <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JBDS-2017">we are working on for JBoss Tools and JBoss Developer Studio</a>, and we got some ideas on how to make it real and already have <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/eclemma/forums/forum/614869/topic/5075364">ideas of improvements</a> to have a better control over Jacoco.</p>
<p>Stay tuned. soon all Java applications will use Jacoco!</p>

         <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>That&#8217;s now a few weeks since I joined the <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.jboss.org/tools">JBoss Tools</a> and <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.jboss.com/products/devstudio/">JBoss Developer Studio</a> team and started working on build. JBoss Tools is a <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.ohloh.net/p/11081/analyses/latest">HUGE amount of code</a>, with about 35 components (or modules in Maven terminology) that are aggregated in a way that can be compared to the Eclipse release train, and that all use a &#8220;Common Build Infrastructure&#8221; based on Maven/<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.eclipse.org/tycho/">Tycho</a> to perform build and <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://hudson.jboss.org/hudson/view/JBossTools/">Jenkins</a> to trigger it.</p>
<p>There are a <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JBIDE/component/12310540">lot of improvements in the pipe</a> for <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://divby0.blogspot.com/">Nick</a> and myself to make build more and more agile, and to make it produce more and more interesting results. I feel very interested in going a step ahead of continuous integration, and open the road towards continuous improvement, automating QA to get reports about static analysis and code coverage on each build. I bet it will help developers to avoid mistakes and improve there code. (Advertising: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.eclipsecon.org/2012/sessions/get-ready-fight-your-technical-debt-tycho-sonar-and-jacoco">You can learn more on this topic during next EclipseCon</a> ).</p>
<p>Here are some of these topics that are worth this blog post:</p>
<h3>QA with Sonar</h3>
<p>About static analysis, my choice fully goes to <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.sonarsource.org/">Sonar</a>, a webapp that provides a dashboard aggregating reports from several QA &#8220;services&#8221; (Findbugs, Checkstyle, Test reports, coverage&#8230;). Sonar provides nice integration with <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://mojo.codehaus.org/sonar-maven-plugin/">Maven</a> and <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://docs.codehaus.org/display/SONAR/Hudson+and+Jenkins+Plugin">Jenkins &amp; Hudson</a>, and getting the whole working together is about a few minutes of configuration. The return on investment when setting up Sonar is very high and immediate. In my humble opinion Sonar is a must-have nowadays.</p>
<p>So, there are 2 bugs I encourage you to look at/vote for, in order to leverage Sonar, QA and continuous improvements in your favourite projects:</p>
<ul>
<li>@Eclipse.org : <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=360935">Set up a Sonar instance of Eclipse projects</a></li>
<li>@JBoss.org: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JBIDE-10777">Set up Sonar for JBoss Tools (and more JBoss stuff?)</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Jacoco, without Sonar</h3>
<p>Jacoco is a very easy-to-set-up code coverage tool, with a very convenient <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.eclemma.org/jacoco/trunk/doc/maven.html">Maven integration</a>. With Jacoco, there is no need for instrumentation step to get coverage results, all is about giving a<em> -java.agent=jacocoagent.jar</em> property to your JVM. While using it, I did not detect any effect on performances. That&#8217;s pretty cool.</p>
<p>The current issue for Jacoco adoption is the reporting. Here are the known ways to analyse reports from a Jacoco coverage output file (aka jacoco.exec):</p>
<ul>
<li>Use the<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.eclemma.org/jacoco/trunk/doc/ant.html#report"> Jacoco Ant task</a> to generate HTML reports</li>
<li>Use the <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/eclemma/ticket/181">Jacoco maven:site integration</a> to generate reports as part of maven:site</li>
<li>Une <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://eclemma.org/userdoc/importexport.html">EclEmma plugin </a>to analyse Jacoco reports in your IDE</li>
<li>Use <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://docs.codehaus.org/display/SONAR/JaCoCo+Plugin">Sonar</a></li>
</ul>
<p>As a fan of Sonar, I think the Sonar-based approach is the best one. But both previous bugs show something clear: despite of my full enthusiasm for Sonar, community-wide infrastructures such as Eclipse.org or JBoss.org cannot set up a Sonar instance immediately. I guess this is because of issues with credentials, or hardware, or IT stuff. So we need to be able to consume Jacoco reports without Sonar.<br />
The issues with all these approaches is that it introduces the need for a new build step or a new developer tool to analyze reports. The main dashboard for JBoss.org builds in <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://hudson.jboss.org/hudson/view/JBossTools/">Jenkins</a> (and <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://hudson.eclipse.org/hudson/?">Hudson</a> for Eclipse.org), then the ideal place for such reports would beÂ  a Jenkins plugin for Jacoco. Unfortunately this does not existt (yet), but a <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-10835">Jenkins issue is open for this</a>. Now that I have lost some optimism in getting Sonar available for Eclipse.org or JBoss.org community quickly (as an impatient guy, quickly means today),<strong> this Jacoco Jenkins is now my #1 wish in the whole Java software world</strong>. Although setting up Jacoco for execution is very easy, setting up integrated reporting is still almost a blocking point for adoption.</p>
<p>So please, vote for this bug!!! <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-10835">iJacoco Jenkins plugin</a></p>
<h3>Some other stuff</h3>
<p>Since I&#8217;m writing here a wish list, I&#8217;d also like to share with you thib Jenkins issue I opened: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-12815">Add an option to select Build status when no Test is found</a>. The idea is simple: Even if no-one should never do that, it happens that we need to run a Jenkins build with skipped tests. <em>Ok, it&#8217;s bad, but it happens.</em> In such case, the fileset for Test results in Jenkins JUnit plugin does not match any existing report, and then build turn to FAILED/Red. When you have cascading of jubs, this is pretty annoying, since you&#8217;d rather see this build UNSTABLE/Yellow -my favourite- or SUCCESS/Blue. So this issue simply requests the ability to change the result of plugin when no test is found.<br />
If you find this useful, you can vote for it.</p>

<p><img class="aligncenter" title="PetalsLink" src="http://www.petalslink.com/themes/bluemarine/logo.png" alt="" width="240" height="84"/></p>
<p>Working for PetalsLink was a quite interesting experience:</p>
<p>On the technical side, I enjoyed moving all the XML-based tooling of <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.petalslink.com/produits/petals-studio">PetalsStudio</a> to a more powerful EMF-based approach for Petals JBI editor &#8211; for those who don&#8217;t know <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=208">JBI</a>, it is a standard that allows to define SOA artifacts in your ESB. Moving to EMF allowed us to provide better tooling faster, because most of the complexity in manipulating JBI can be removed with very few efforts leveraging <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://download.eclipse.org/modeling/emf/emf/javadoc/2.5.0/org/eclipse/emf/ecore/util/ExtendedMetaData.html">EMF ExtendedMetaData</a>. That was the first time I faced this part of EMF, and I got pretty impressed of how well it works (working with EMF always gives this impression of &#8220;being well&#8221;). I also improved the ability to plug new JBI components into the Studio, which is a critical point when you have to deal with connectors for almost everything &#8211; Mail, SFTP, Talend, XSLT&#8230;. So that was an interesting challenge in term of conception and development.<br />
Petals Studio was also the pretext to start using <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://git.petalslink.com/">Git</a>, <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/petalslink/petals-studio">GitHub</a> and <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.sonarsource.org/">Sonar</a>. I am pretty happy to have learnt these 3 tools that clearly improved the way I work.</p>
<p>Also, I had the great opportunity to work closely to several Eclipse projects:</p>
<ul>
<li>I could contribute the Tycho build of GMF Tooling, put it on <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://hudson.eclipse.org/hudson/job/tycho-gmp.gmf.tooling/">Hudson</a>, get source moved to <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://git.eclipse.org/c/gmf-tooling/org.eclipse.gmf-tooling.git">Git</a>/mirrored to <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/eclipse/gmf-tooling">GitHub</a>, improve <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://wiki.eclipse.org/Graphical_Modeling_Framework">wiki</a>&#8230; GMF Tooling is a project I&#8217;ve used for 3 years now and I often saw in it some critical organization points to improve to make it more dynamic in term of development. Working at PetalsLink gave me the opportunity to do what I think was necessary to keep the project healthy. With the help of Michael Golubev, I now think this was an real success.</li>
<li>I could contribute to Nebula the <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.eclipse.org/nebula/widgets/treemapper/treemapper.php">TreeMapper</a> widget, which will probably have some very interesting use-cases soon. As I became a committer, I also helped in improving Tycho build and <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://hudson.eclipse.org/hudson/job/nebula.nebula/">CI</a>, nad it seems like the project liked it if we look at the <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.eclipse.org/nebula/downloads.php">new p2 update-sites</a>.</li>
<li>I contributed some small improvements to Eclipse BPEL designer, tried (unsuccessfully) to make SWTBot use Tycho, and developed a <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/draw2d-preview">useful extension for Draw2d</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The only thing I wish I would be able to do here is to push ahead the usage of <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=360935">Sonar at Eclipse</a>, at least for GMF Tooling and Nebula.</p>
<p>But I probably learnt even more things from PetalsLink by discovering another company organisation that is very different from what I could experiment before (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.openwide.fr/">OpenWide</a> and <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.bonitasoft.com/">BonitaSoft</a>): PetalsLink is focused on the Research about SOA and agility of Systems of Information. It is a wide topic! Petals products are quite good compared to other alternatives in the SOA landscape, but they don&#8217;t meet the success they deserve, it was a bit frustrating for a developer.</p>
<p>I enjoyed working for PetalsLink, all the expectations are fulfilled, so it is time for me to go ahead, to find a new experience, a new team, new challenges, new issues&#8230; I love discovering new things!</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why I&#8217;ll start working for JBoss|Red Hat tomorrow, as part of the team developing <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.jboss.org/tools">JBoss Tools</a> and <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.jboss.com/products/devstudio/">JBoss Developer Studio</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://mickaelistria.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/jboss_logo.png"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-316" title="jboss_logo" src="http://mickaelistria.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/jboss_logo.png?w=253&#038;h=144" alt="" width="253" height="144"/></a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">I&#8217;ll have the opportunity to work with a great team! My main occupation for the next monthes will be to assist <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://divby0.blogspot.com/">Nick Boldt</a> in making JBoss Tools CI and build infrastructure better and better. I&#8217;d also like to open the road towards efficient QA for JBoss Tools, including -among other- usage of Jacoco and Sonar. Then I&#8217;ll also work on developing nice stuff for some JBoss Tools modules, most probably on the SOA/BPM part.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">That&#8217;s gonna be a lot of fun! I&#8217;m eager to be tomorrow and actually get started for this new team/employer/project/product/users.</p>
